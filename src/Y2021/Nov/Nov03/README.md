# [407. Trapping Rain Water II](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/trapping-rain-water-ii/)

Given an `m x n` integer matrix `heightMap` representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, return *the volume of water it can trap after raining*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: heightMap = [[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: After the rain, water is trapped between the blocks.
We have two small pounds 1 and 3 units trapped.
The total volume of water trapped is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: heightMap = [[3,3,3,3,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,2,1,2,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,3,3,3,3]]
Output: 10
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == heightMap.length`
- `n == heightMap[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `0 <= heightMap[i][j] <= 2 * 104`
